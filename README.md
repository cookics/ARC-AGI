# ARC-AGI Psychometric Analysis

This repository contains scripts for analyzing the dimensionality, difficulty, and psychometric properties of the ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence) tasks.

## Project Structure

- `arc_v1_dimensionality.R`: R script for performing factor analysis (EFA/CFA) and IRT on ARC-AGI v1.
- `ARC1and2.R`: R script for comparative analysis of ARC-AGI v1 and v2.
- `psych.R`: General psychometric utility functions and analysis.
- `img_matrix.py`: Python script for generating image matrices of ARC tasks.
- `scoring.py`: Python script for automated task scoring.
- `walkthroughs/`: Permanent archive of analysis walkthroughs and results.
